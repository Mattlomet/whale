	<h1>School Outreach Programs</h1>



	<h2>WHALES ON WHEELS (WOW™)</h2>

	<p>These exceptional hands-on educational programs are funded by grants, memberships, proceeds from  Adopt A Whale Kits, and memorials. Programs are currently offered in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties, California.

	Call to book a presentation(s) at: (831) 899-9957</p>

	<h2>*NEW Amazing Lives of Sea Turtles</h2>

	<p>Explore sea turtle evolution, anatomy, and conservation, and look at one of the most remarkable and specialized marine creatures that travel throughout the world’s oceans. They have been on earth over 100 million years and now face the threat of extinction. Learn about their ecology and human impacts that affect their survival like fishing practices, illegal shell trading/egg poaching, oil pollution and marine debris that has accumulated into massive garbage patches. Hands-on activities will include: identifying the 7 unique species of sea turtles using a collection of skulls and turtles; determining feeding techniques and diet; and exploring their life cycle and survival threats. A selected student will wear a Leatherback Sea Turtle costume to demonstrate adaptation (for lower grade levels). Find out how you can help Save The Sea Turtles! Grades 3-Adult</p>

	<h2>*NEW Endangered Species</h2>

	<p>Learn how species are linked and dependent upon each other within their ecosystems, and the importance of saving biodiversity. Hands-on activities will further explore the value of sanctuaries, parks, and reserves (Marine Protected Areas) as tools for conserving marine life. Touch the life-sized model of a vaquita calf porpoise, the world’s most-endangered cetacean, and learn how gillnets endanger their lives. A selected student will wear a habitat costume to demonstrate how plants, fishes, animals, rocks, air, water, sun and people are all connected in the Earth’s web of life (for lower grade levels). Grades 2-Adult</p>

	<h2>*NEW Whale of a Rhythm Program (WOARP)</h2>

	<p>Journey into the rhythmic world of whale and dolphin communication via multi-media, hands-on set of integrated classroom activities. Our instructor(s) will help students use drums and other percussion instruments to imitate cetacean songs and communicate with each other. Together they will discover how difficult communication becomes when mingled with noises made by ships and other man-made sounds. Students will learn grade-appropriate basics of whale and dolphin communication and the importance of conserving cetaceans and their habitats. Grades 2-Adult</p>

	<h2>The Land & Sea Watershed Model</h2>

	<p>See how human actions on land flow directly to the sea through storm drains. Students will “pollute” the hands-on model and simulate rain, which leads to creeks, rivers and oceans. Learn how one person can make a difference. Grades 3-Adult</p>

	<h2>Whales On Wheels (WOW™)</h2>

	<p>Dive-in with a mini-museum of hands-on marine mammal artifacts and conservation messages. WOW™ brings bones of baleen and toothed whales, clicks of cetaceans, pelts of pinnipeds, skulls of sea mammals, and tales of toothed whales. A very educational program providing a breadth of understanding of marine mammals and the delicate balance that binds us together. Grades 3-Adult
