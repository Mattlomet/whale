WHALES ON WHEELS (WOW™)

These exceptional hands-on educational programs are funded by grants, memberships, proceeds from Adopt A Whale Kits, and memorials. Programs are currently offered in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties, California.

Call to book a presentation(s) at: (831) 899-9957

*NEW Amazing Lives of Sea Turtles

Explore sea turtle evolution, anatomy, and conservation, and look at one of the most remarkable and specialized marine creatures that travel throughout the world’s oceans. They have been on earth over 100 million years and now face the threat of extinction. Learn about their ecology and human impacts that affect their survival like fishing practices, illegal shell trading/egg poaching, oil pollution and marine debris that has accumulated into massive garbage patches. Hands-on activities will include: identifying the 7 unique species of sea turtles using a collection of skulls and turtles; determining feeding techniques and diet; and exploring their life cycle and survival threats. A selected student will wear a Leatherback Sea Turtle costume to demonstrate adaptation (for lower grade levels). Find out how you can help Save The Sea Turtles! Grades 3-Adult

*NEW Endangered Species

Learn how species are linked and dependent upon each other within their ecosystems, and the importance of saving biodiversity. Hands-on activities will further explore the value of sanctuaries, parks, and reserves (Marine Protected Areas) as tools for conserving marine life. Touch the life-sized model of a vaquita calf porpoise, the world’s most-endangered cetacean, and learn how gillnets endanger their lives. A selected student will wear a habitat costume to demonstrate how plants, fishes, animals, rocks, air, water, sun and people are all connected in the Earth’s web of life (for lower grade levels). Grades 2-Adult

*NEW Whale of a Rhythm Program (WOARP)

Journey into the rhythmic world of whale and dolphin communication via multi-media, hands-on set of integrated classroom activities. Our instructor(s) will help students use drums and other percussion instruments to imitate cetacean songs and communicate with each other. Together they will discover how difficult communication becomes when mingled with noises made by ships and other man-made sounds. Students will learn grade-appropriate basics of whale and dolphin communication and the importance of conserving cetaceans and their habitats. Grades 2-Adult

The Land & Sea Watershed Model

See how human actions on land flow directly to the sea through storm drains. Students will “pollute” the hands-on model and simulate rain, which leads to creeks, rivers and oceans. Learn how one person can make a difference. Grades 3-Adult

Whales On Wheels (WOW™)

Dive-in with a mini-museum of hands-on marine mammal artifacts and conservation messages. WOW™ brings bones of baleen and toothed whales, clicks of cetaceans, pelts of pinnipeds, skulls of sea mammals, and tales of toothed whales. A very educational program providing a breadth of understanding of marine mammals and the delicate balance that binds us together. Grades 3-Adult

WOW™ brings you:

Bones of baleen whales
Clicks of cetaceans
Pelts of pinnipeds
Skulls of sea mammals
Tales of toothed whales
 WOW™ has travelled across the nation visiting school children in Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and California. WOW™ is now based in Monterey, California.

Our instructional staff is made up of degreed marine biologists, environmental educators, and researchers. The background experience of the staff includes: Catalina Island Marine Institute instructors and assistant program directors, Los Angeles Unified School District teachers, oceanography research and sampling, published killer whale research, and international environmental studies.

Whether your group is at a school, a museum, or local library, WOW™ will visit you. Knowledgeable instructors emphasize marine conservation and make learning about whales and their relatives easy and fun.

In 1994, we began presenting WOW™ with bilingual educator, Mauricio Quiroga, a native of Latin America, in order to reach the large number of Hispanic school children in Los Angeles schools who speak English as a second language. WOW™ has reached over 50,000 bilingual elementary school students, ages 6-12 (1-6th grade), with a geographic range covering the greater Los Angeles area and surrounding counties.

WOW™ is one of the only hands-on programs presenting marine environmental science programs to bilingual students. WOW™ programs emphasize why humans, as land mammals, should help mammals that live in the sea and learn how their individual actions can make a difference in protecting marine life.

This exceptional educational program is funded by grants, memberships, proceeds from Adopt A Whale kits, and memorials. WOW™ currently serves the Monterey & Santa Cruz, California area. Call to book a lecture (831) 899-9957.

Marine Mammals: Adaptations and Communication

Discover behavioral adaptations and communications of whales and dolphins in their marine environment. A multimedia presentation with hands-on feeding and communication stations: learn about the food web, touch baleen and marine mammal skulls, and view blubber, krill and whale lice. The program includes listening and learning about whale and dolphin sounds. A selected student will wear a whale costume to demonstrate adaptation (for lower grade levels). Grades 1-Adult

Sea Otters: A Story of Survival

Explore the natural history, ecology and survival of the California sea otters. This multimedia presentation, with hands-on stations, covers topics as diverse as feeding and keystone species, adaptations and survival, human impacts and pollution. A selected student will wear a sea otter costume to demonstrate adaptation (for lower grade levels). Learn how you can help protect sea otters from extinction! Grades 1-Adult.

For lower grade levels, a selected student will wear a gray whale, sea otter, kelp forest or leatherback sea turtle costume to demonstrate adaptation.

Testimonials:

“The touch stations proved to be the ultimate prize! They liked the whale costume and its step-by-step process of adding each individual “body part” (blubber, flukes, baleen, etc) that engaged the whole class and lent itself to yet another fun way to explore these magnificent creatures.” Dianna Higginbotham, Principal of Valencia Elementary School & Karin Kerber-Smith, Science Assembly Chair Home and School Club

“The combination of hands-on, powerpoint, discussion and the diversity were just great and really engaged the children. This is the authentic learning that we teachers are always striving for!” Kay Cline, Marina Del Mar Elementary School
